# Missile Command
Indy Dev Winter 2018 Challenge.
Remake of the classic 1980 arcade game. Made using MonoGame 3.7 in Visual Studio 2017. Art made with Magicavoxel.
Sound made with Bfxr. Custom 3D PO game library that I made was used too. Game runs in a 1200 by 900 window.
I got as close to the orginal as I could in gameplay.
To Play:
Use ZXC to fire missiles. Arrow keys or mouse to move cursor. P to pause, Esc to quite at any time.
Or use the mouse at the menu as it will automaticly be released.
